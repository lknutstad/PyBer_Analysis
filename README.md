# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
Here we will be using data from Pyber to create a summary of ride-sharing data by city type.


# Objective
First, Pandas is used to create a ride-sharing DataFrame by city type.  Then, matplotlib will be used to produce a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

# Results

Below are summary statistics of the PyBer data
![Fig9](analysis/Fig9.png)

Total Rides:
-13x urban:rural 
-2.5x urban:suburban

Total Drivers:
-111x urban:rural 
-7x urban:suburban

Total Fares:
-9.5x urban:rural 
-2x urban:suburban

Average fare per Ride:
1.1x **rural:urban**
1.4x **rural:suburban**

Average fare per driver:
13x **rural:urban**
3.5x **rural:suburban**

Urban cities has twice the total fares as Suburban cities and 10 times the total fares as rural cities.  The overall variation does not significantly effect the analysis.
