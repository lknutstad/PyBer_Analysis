# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
Here we will be using data from Pyber to create a summary of ride-sharing data by city type.


# Objective
First, Pandas is used to create a ride-sharing DataFrame by city type.  Then, matplotlib will be used to produce a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

# Results

## Thomas High School Relative Performance
